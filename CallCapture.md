Dear C# Developers,

We are seeking skilled C# developers to help expand our CallCapture application, a comprehensive call recording solution for Windows. The current features include recording, playback, deletion, and export/import of recordings, as well as call log management and search functionality. We aim to enhance its capabilities with new features such as advanced audio processing, cloud storage integration, and a more intuitive user interface. If you have experience in C# and a passion for developing robust applications, we would love to collaborate with you on this exciting project.
